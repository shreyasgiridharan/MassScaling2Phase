# MassScaling2Phase
An explicit finite element code where masses of solid and fluid are scaled to increase the critical time step.

The main subroutines are written in main.f90. Use that as a starting point. 

An example input file is provided in input.dat. 

The original program accepts input file only with the name 'input.dat'. You can however change that to whatever you want in main.f90.

You will need GiD to pre- and post process the simulation.

If you encounted any errors, bugs or improvements, please contact shreyas.giridharan@gmail.com.
